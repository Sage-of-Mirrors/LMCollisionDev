# LMCollisionDev

This repositiory is being used to develop code that will eventually be able to generate custom collision data for the
GameCube game *Luigi's Mansion*, as well as convert that collision data to a Wavefront OBJ file for editing.

This project utilizes a library called AssImp (AssetImporter) for loading model files to be converted into collision data.
That means that any model format that AssImp supports can be converted into collision data for *Luigi's Mansion*.

Information about the collision data can be found at the [repository's wiki](https://github.com/Sage-of-Mirrors/LMCollisionDev/wiki).
